# Dotfiles for Garuda Linux Hyprland

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring and customizing my Garuda Linux system running the [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) Wayland compositor. These configuration files are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for easy deployment and modular organization.

  - **fish** (shell)
  - And more...
- Modular management with GNU Stow for simplicity and flexibility.
